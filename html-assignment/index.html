        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Fianna Murphy and I am a currently a student at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. I enjoy spending time with friends and family, exploring new places, and trying different hobbies whenever I can. I think life is more fun when you keep yourself curious and open to new experiences. In my free time, I like to listen to music, read books, and go on walks to clear my head and enjoy the outdoors.</p>

        <p>I'm the kind of person who values simple things like good conversations and laughter. I try to stay positive even when life gets tough, because I believe challenges are just another way to grow stronger. Whether it's learning something new, helping someone out, or just enjoying a quiet moment, I try to make the most of each day. To me, it's like getting a 2<sup>nd</sup> chance every morning to do things a little better.</p>
